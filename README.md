[EN]: This repository serves as an index for various Java-based projects and code examples. Each linked repository demonstrates different aspects of Java programming, including authentication, database handling, design patterns, security, and web development. The goal is to provide practical examples that can be used as references for learning and development. For more in-depth discussions and technical articles, visit my LinkedIn and Medium profiles.
